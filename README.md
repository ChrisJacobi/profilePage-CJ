Profile Page and Code Louisville project by Chris Jacobi


My goal for this project was to make a fully responsive, easy to navigate website displaying information about myself and my skills with a validating contact form. I took a minimalistic approach while designing; making sure to maintain a consistent, professional style. The website is mobile first design and has a working hamburger navigation. The contact form checks for validation in all inputs, as well as proper formatting for the email submission.


My features used:

1) A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon.

    I accomplished this feature by using a "hamburger" icon to display mobile navigation while switching over to a horizontal style navigation for desktop and larger screens.

2) Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views.

    I accomplished this feature by using BOTH Flexbox and CSS Grid throughout all pages for responsiveness. Most pages on the site switch to multiple columns while at larger screens and stick to one column at mobile sizes.

3) Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow.

    I accomplished this feature by having a contact page with a contact form. The form checks for validation using javascript to make sure the email is properly formatted and no fields are left blank. You will not get the "thanks for contacting me" message unless all fields are properly filled out.

4) Create at least 3 variables (var, const, or let), set their values in JavaScript, and display the values somewhere on your page.

    I accomplished this feature by using a total of 6 variables throughout my javascript files. "hamBtn, navTab, luck, fields, valid, rsn"

5) Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code. 

    I accomplished this feature by hiding the "You're in luck" text in index.html everytime the hamburger icon is pressed and have it reappear again once the navTab is closed using javascript.
